The Synonym Dialog
******************


Use the *Synonym* dialog to substitute the name of a target object with a user-defined synonym.

The *Synonym* dialog organizes the development of a synonym through the *General* tab. The *SQL* tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the *General* tab to identify the synonym:

* Use the *Name* field to specify the alternate name for the target object. The name will be displayed in the *pgAdmin* tree control.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Owner* to select a role.
* Select the name of the local schema in which the synonym will reside from the drop-down listbox in the *Schema* field.

In the definition panel, identify the target:

* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Target Type* to select the the type of object the synonym references.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Target Schema* to select the name of the target schema.
* Use the drop-down listbox next to *Target Object* to select the name of the target object.

Click the *SQL* tab to continue.

Your entries in the *Synonym* dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the *SQL* tab for review; revisit the *General* tab to make any changes to the SQL command.
